-- 1. How  can we store large-object types?
-- Character large objects (CLOBs)
-- Use the CLOB data type to store SBCS or mixed data, such as documents that contain single character set.

-- Double-byte character large objects (DBCLOBs)
-- Use the DBCLOB data type to store large amounts of DBCS data, such as documents that use a DBCS character set.

-- Binary large objects (BLOBs)
-- Use the BLOB data type to store large amounts of noncharacter data, such as pictures, voice, and mixed media.
